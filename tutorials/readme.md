# Tutorials

The best way to learn how to use `ucompress` is by working through the tutorials.  The tutorials are roughly ordered in terms of complexity and importance, so starting from the first tutorial and working down is the recommended approach.  If you want to make a quick start, then the best place to start would be [Tutorial 2](/tutorials/02-DisplacementControlledLoading.ipynb), [Tutorial 4](/tutorials/04-ChangingParameters.ipynb), and [Tutorial 6](/tutorials/06-ForceControlledLoading.ipynb).

## Overview of tutorials

* [Tutorial 1](/tutorials/01-ModelOverview.ipynb) - Provides an overview of the components of a `ucompress` model.  Discusses the built-in models.
* [Tutorial 2](/tutorials/02-DisplacementControlledLoading.ipynb) - Shows how to setup and run a displacement-controlled unconfined compression experiment with a poroelastic material.  
* [Tutorial 3](/tutorials/03-Non-dimensionalisation.ipynb) - Illustrates how to work with non-dimensional parameter sets in `ucompress`.
* [Tutorial 4](/tutorials/04-ChangingParameters.ipynb) - Shows how to change a parameter value.
* [Tutorial 5](/tutorials/05-StressStrainCurves.ipynb) - Illustrates how to compute a stress-strain curve.
* [Tutorial 6](/tutorials/06-ForceControlledLoading.ipynb) - Shows how to setup and run a force-controlled unconfined compression experiment with a poroelastic material.
* [Tutorial 7](/tutorials/07-FibreReinforcedMaterials.ipynb) - Provides an overview of how to work with fibre-reinforced materials and the different models that are available.
* [Tutorial 8](/tutorials/08-SolverOptions.ipynb) - Discusses how the solver options can be customised.  This is useful if you are seeing errors about the solver not converging.
* [Tutorial 9](/tutorials/09-Hydrogels.ipynb) - Illustrates how to work with hydrogel-based materials in `ucompress`.
* [Tutorial 10](/tutorials/10-FittingStressStrain.ipynb) - Showcases how to fit a `ucompress` model to instantaneous stress-strain data
